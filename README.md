# HTML to Markdown

This is a test project I built for the Microsoft Learn to Word conversion tool. The original implementation relied on access to the source Markdown files located in GitHub. But often, these files are private - which required a PAT that could then access them. This library was an experience to see if we could generate the Markdown directly from the published HTML files.

There are two projects:

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [ConvertDocsPageToMarkdown](./ConvertDocsPageToMarkdown) | This is a test project that utilizes the class library to convert various articles and training types to a Markdown file on the desktop. |
| [DocsToMarkdown](./src) | This is the class library that contains all the conversion logic. It's tailored specifically for the HTML generated by Microsoft Learn and is capable of creating a very close version of the source Markdown. |

The library depends on a few additional libraries --

- [HTML Agility Pack](https://html-agility-pack.net/)
- [MS Learn Catalog API](https://github.com/markjulmar/MSLearnCatalogAPI)
